    "There seem to be quite a lot of outliers especially in categories 1-4. However, I find these outliers to be reasonable values by observing my initial dataset. A small population(relatively) of rich people do have a huge daily sum of energy consumption. This is most probably due to having a lot of things and activities that consumes electricity but possibly not having technologies installed to minimize power consumption. This also is further explained by the fixed 'std' electricity tarriff that I find being paid by all 'affluent' households with energy sums above 200kwh. but for the sake of trying to build a reliable model, I will not include these households.(I have modified my sql query above to fix this).
